# Training
 
A larger project where I'm building a training scheduler for cycling (can create training sessions ahead of time and then can create the workouts as a .fit file that I can import onto my Garmin).
Currently mapping out the project. Will clean the repo when implemented most of the utils.

### Current goals:
[**goal #1**] Working console core app  
[**goal #2**] Ui with ImGUI  
[**goal #3**] Creating own workouts for Garmin with .fit sdk
